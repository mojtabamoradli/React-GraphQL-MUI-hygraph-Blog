# How to use
```diff
+ Download / Clone Project
+ 🕹 cd to the project folder
+ 🕹 Run: npm i
+ For the backend I used hygraph and I didn't delete my key so it can be used to see a sample
+ In case you have a hygraph project ready to go, just change the key in .env 
+ 🕹 Run: npm start
+ voilà 🤌🏼
```

Enjoy 🚀
